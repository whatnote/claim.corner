<h2>Claims Portal</h2>
<p>All injury claims -  Motor Injury - EL and PL Injury Claims
More Info - http://www.claimsportal.org.uk/en/ 
Motor claims with injury go directly to the insurers, so almost always weâ€™ll get the notification of injury form insurers. We just need to get the claim form from the client in the usual way. 

 PL and EL Injury claims slightly different initial notification from the third party solicitors to the client and needs to be sent to insuresr. If we can also ask for details of wages also useful.
The main benefit of the portal it keeps costs down, low value injury claims have fixed fees if dealt with via the portal. There are time limits attached to keeping claims in the portal if they are breach the claim will fall out of the portal and normal solicitors fees apply. However if the client things the matter is made up insurers will allow the claim to fall out
