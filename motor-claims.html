   <h1>Motor Claims</h1>

<div>
<h2>Standard on all claims</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Photos of Damage</li>
<li>Estimate of repairs</li>
<li>Invoice of repairs</li>
<li>More essential if the client needs to self authorise the repairs to get the vehicle on the road, equally essential if the repair falls below the excess and there’s scope for a partial recovery. Or there is a chance or recovery. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Legal Expense - Used to recover uninsured losses.</h2>
newclaim@das.co.uk 
Almost always with DAS. To locate on the system click on the motor policy, click “AMD” then click “Lex” clicl accept to close. 
We do undertake the recovery of excess and the more simple UL ourselves.  Eg  small periods of hire. 
ON EVERY INSTRUCTION
When instructing DAS as a new claim we need to ask they don’t contact the client in the first instance and all communication to be with us.

<h2>Total Loss Claims</h2>
<ul>
<li>Miaftr2 database</li>
<li>Total Losses - 4 Categories  A,B,N and S</li>
<li>A & B client can’t retain salvage, usually have to scrapped A or taken for parts B. </li>
<li> & S Client may be able to retain salvage depends on the insurers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Total loss offer, almost always can argue for an increase, best way is to look at either Autotrader http://www.autotrader.co.uk  or EBay http://www.ebay.co.uk/motors find three examples that show a better price and the offer should go north. </p>

<h2>Driving Licence Changes</h2>
<p>With effect from the 8th June the DVLA will be abolishing paper counterpart driving licences for GB licences (so ex Northern Ireland).
This will in turn affect the procedures that we adopt with regard to licence checking.</p>
<p>Clients will be able to access their own counterpart by visiting the following website
https://www.viewdrivingrecord.service.gov.uk/driving-record/licence-number
They will be required to input their driving licence number, postcode and National Insurance number.</p>
<P>In all cases where you currently request and validate a copy driving licence, you must now request a copy of the photocard and ask them to download a copy of their counterpart which will be in PDF format, and they can either email or send this to us for checking. The counterpart is dated with the time that the document is produced and we would need to see a current download and not an old one.
The client has an option to request code that they can forward us to check the licence. However as this code is only valid for 72 hours I do not recommend us using this process unless we are dealing with the matter in real time over the telephone. In these circumstances we need the last 8 digits of their driving licence number and the code and need to visit https://www.viewdrivingrecord.service.gov.uk/driving-record/validate
With regard to Companies and fleet policies, Employers do have the option to purchase checking services which carry out checks without the requirement for the above.  The services that these companies provide include</P>
